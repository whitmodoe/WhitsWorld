        <p>Above is our precious beagle, Daisy. She is truly just the sweetest thing. She wouldn't 
         hurt a fly, and she has the patience of a saint. Food motivated of the highest order. 
         Our girl <strong>loves</strong> a snacky snack.</p>

         <p>My amazing partner surprised me with Teddy in May 2020 in the midst of covid.
          I took one look at that precious little kitten, and we <em>instantly</em>
          formed a connection. She's my baby.</p>
